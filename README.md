Gwen
====

Gwen is a [Gherkin](https://docs.cucumber.io/gherkin/reference/) interpreter that turns Given-When-Then steps into automation instructions and executes them for you so you don't 
have to do all the programming work. It has an abstracted 
[evaluation engine](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Evaluation-Engines) allowing any type of automation capability to be built and mixed in.
[Meta specifications](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Meta-Features) (also expressed in Gherkin) are used to capture automation bindings and allow you to compose step definitions in a declarative manner.

Why Gwen?
---------

> Gwen = [G]iven [W]hen Th[en]

We wanted to make automation with executable specifications simpler for everyone and easier for non developers with little to no coding experience. So we developed an interpreter to read plain text Gherkin features as input and produce executing automation instructions as output through automation engines that can be developed and shared.

What engines are available?
---------------------------

- [gwen-web](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web)
 Â - A web automation engine for Gwen that you can download and use to quickly automate web application testing and
    robotic online processing without having to manage native browser drivers, develop page objects or write Selenium code.

Core Runtime Requirement
------------------------

- Java SE 8 Runtime Environment
